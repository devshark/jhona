Jonalyn

Who is Jonalyn?

How would I start describing this lady? She is an Architecture student at the time of this writing, about 163 cm tall, fair skin, black short hair, average body build, round eyes, and an incredibly admirable dimples. I never really knew her very well. We just started chatting, texting, talking, but I never really knew her aside from her side-stories. It's probably because I was afraid of asking deeper questions because it might bring up more questions and end up on misunderstanding. She is really a mystery for a fearful guy like me. I liked her though I don't know her. What I know about her is that she is special. She has a lot of insights about a lot of things, especially in life.

 as I am afraid of emotional attachments to anyone
